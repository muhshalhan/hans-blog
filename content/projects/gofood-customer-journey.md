## Situation

I was hired as a Data Analyst at Gojek, a ride-hailing and delivery company. I <u> collaborated with product and business teams </u> to <b> define metrics </b> and <b> analyze customer journeys for GoFood </b>, Gojek's food delivery service.

### Backround

Gojek is a super app providing ride-hailing, food delivery, and digital payment services in Southeast Asia. GoFood, their food delivery business, has grown rapidly but faces fierce competition.

While Gojek tracks high-level business metrics, they <b> lacked visibility into detailed customer journeys and events </b>. This made it <u> difficult to diagnose pain points and identify opportunities to optimize engagement and conversion </u>. For example, they could not pinpoint where customers were dropping off in the order process.

Gojek <u> needed more comprehensive analytics to drive product improvements and business growth </u>. By implementing granular <b> tracking of customer events throughout the GoFood journey </b>, Gojek could gain <b> data-driven insights into user behavior to inform key product decisions </b>. The goal was to leverage analytics to create a frictionless experience that delights customers.

### Problem Definition

The problem was that <b> <u> Gojek lacked visibility into key events and metrics across the customer journey </u> </b>. This made it <u> difficult to identify opportunities to improve engagement, conversion, and retention </u>.

### Objective

The objective was to:
1. Implement <b> customer journey analysis </b> to capture GoFood app flow 
2. Apply <b> event tracking to identify suitable metrics </b> or any improvement of metrics for better customer behavior analysis

## Task & Action

| Task | Action | Reason |
|-|-|-|
| Define tracking plan | Identify key customer events to track based on goals, such as app opens, button clicks, transactions | Capturing granular event data is crucial for understanding user journeys |
| Validate event tracking | Try to involved directly into apps UI, put yourself as a customer who want to order GoFood | This gives you more clear detail about event that already available and can take more improvements |  
| Create event dictionaries | Documented details like event names, triggers, properties, and metrics for each event | Event dictionaries align teams on tracking implementation and analysis |
| Determine event metrics | Choose relevant event metrics like counts, trends, funnels, and cohorts to uncover insights | Tracking accurate and suitable metrics can illuminate opportunities to improve metrics like retention and conversion |

## Result - Slide Deck

In general, I've already identified 15 events for customer journey with their metrics, starting from installing Gojek Apps until GoFood order finished. For more details, you can see my deck:
